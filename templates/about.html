                The idea of a recipe website isn't something new, but this website is moving the goal post's by making 
                The Fitness Kitchen a one stop shop for all your healthy recipes. 
                Everyone has endless access to different recipe's, from Influencers to tv chefs, 
                and from websites or social media pages to the old fashioned recipe book. 
                One problem people face, is they have to trawl through all these mediums to find the recipe they are looking for. 
                The Fitness Kitchen is the solution.
