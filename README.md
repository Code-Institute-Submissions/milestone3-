# **The Fitness Kitchen** 

As part of my Milestone 3 project with [Code Institute]( https://codeinstitute.net/) i was challenged with designing, developing and implementing a back-end for a web application using Python and the
[flask micro-framework]( https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/), allowing users to create, read, update and delete(CRUD) data entries on a fully responsive full stack web application. 

I have decided to create an online healthy cooking recipe website which promotes healthy meals. All the recipes are healthy nutritious meals, which are also tasty and eye catching proving to the user that eating healthy doesn’t have to be mundane. 
Each recipe includes everyday ingredients you can find in your local supermarket, and have easy to follow preparation and cooking methods that accommodates people of all cooking skill levels. 
Users are able to add, delete and update their own recipes so the website can be a one stop shop for all their healthy recipes.

## **USER EXPERIENCE (UX)**
The idea of a recipe website isn't something new, but this website is moving the goal post's by making <strong>'The Healthy Kitchen'</strong> a one stop shop for all your healthy recipes. Everyone has endless access to different recipe's, from influencers to tv chefs, and  from websites or social media pages to the old fashioned recipe book. One problem users face, is they have to trawl through all these mediums to find their recipe. The <strong>'The Healthy Kitchen'</strong> is the solution. Registered Users can add, edit and delete their own recipes and have access to all the other recipes uploaded to the website. Un-registered users also have access to the recipes on the website the main difference being they don't have access to the CRUD functionality.

Users can filter the recipes to select meals from the following categories: /breakfast meals/lunch/dinner/vegetarian category/Gluten Free. 


-   ### **USER STORIES** 
  
 1. As a user I want to see healthy nutritious meals that encourage me to cook and eat healthy.
     - When the user comes to the main page of the site they are greeted with all the various recipes and a brief supporting summary of each meal.

  2. As a user I want the recipes to be broken into categories so I can filter the recipes shown to me.  
     - Reason for filtering option where user can select between breakfast, lunch or dinner food recipes and also a vegetarian filter. 
    
3. As a user I want to get more detailed look once I click on the recipe title/image.
    - Supporting html page for each recipe with detailed information for the meal and the method of preparation.  

4. As a user I want to be able to add my own recipes so I can use this website as a one stop shop for all my recipes. 
    - Reason for ‘Add Your Own Recipe Page’. 

5. As a user I want to be able to delete or update/edit the recipes I added to the website.
    - Reason for users being able to edit/delete their recipes.

6. As a user I want to easily understand the purpose of the site and learn what the owner’s beliefs are.
   - Reason for about page. 

7. As a site owner, I want to ensure my website is secure, and I want to keep a dataset of my users.
    - Reason for login/registration. 


-   ### **WIREFRAMES**

After reading the project brief i formulated a idea and jotted down notes and rough sketches on pen and paper. These ideas evolved into creating user stories which helped me formulate a plan to draw up some wireframes.
I used [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/) to build the wireframes. I created mockups for desktop, tablet and mobile viewports, so i could have an idea of what my website would look like, and i could follow a plan to avoid scope creep.
